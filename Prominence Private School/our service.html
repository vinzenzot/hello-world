									<h3>Nursery Room</h3>
									<p>The baby room is for babies between 3 month and 1 year of age. The children’s schedule in the baby class will be prepared to meet their individual needs.<br><br>Parents communicate with the teachers the child’s sleeping and eating schedule. And in turn the teachers communicate with the parents daily regarding the child’s naps, meals and diaper changes. Each child has their own space with their own cribs for naptime.<br><br>The children do share bouncy seats, swings and highchairs, which are sanitized on a regular basis.<br><br> Our baby room teachers offer lots of love to the children and help them discover the world around them as they grow and learn to crawl and walk. In the baby room our teachers work with the children on hand eye coordination an how to entertain themselves through play. The baby room offers both a calm, comforting environment for naptime and stimulating environment for playtime and learning.<br><br> We play music and have lots of colorful different toys for the children as they begin to crawl and explore. Our main focus in the baby room is providing the children with lots of love.
